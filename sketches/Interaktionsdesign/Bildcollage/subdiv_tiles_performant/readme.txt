Processing-Script: Subdividing-Tiles (Performant version)

Note. This version is not only faster, but produces a completely different result than the standard version!
In the end it comes down to personal preference which version to use.

This one doesn't handle tiles as objects but instead uses the info from the last frame to iterate the subdivisions and is therefore imense faster,
but also creates finer tiles

Usage:
    Mouse:
        Press once to subdivide the current tile
        
        While dragging the tiles at the cursor will be subdivided instantly.

    Keyboard:
        s: take a screenshot
        l: load a different image
        c: clear the canvas
