Processing-Script: Subdividing-Tiles

Usage:
    Mouse:
        Press once to subdivide the current tile
        Press on the same spot again to subdivide a random tile
        
        While dragging the tiles at the cursor will be subdivided instantly.
        This will most likely also subdivide random tiles if the mouse isn't moving fast enough
    
    Keyboard:
        [1 - 9]:  change minimum tile-size for subdivisions while dragging
        s: take a screenshot
        l: load a different image
        c: clear the canvas
        f: toggle Fancy-Mode (Centered images at the cost of making your pc explode!)
