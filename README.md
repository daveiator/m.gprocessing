## A Processing script dump

Hello, this is my little collection of Processing-Scripts which I made as part of my course of study "mgp" at [University Offenburg](https://www.hs-offenburg.de/).



Feel free to share or modify the code, but maybe change out the images! ;)

__Disclaimer:__ There might be  German in some names.
__Disclaimer 2:__ Some images might have been removed since I stole them from the interwebs
